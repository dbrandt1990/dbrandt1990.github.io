I have been working as a massage therapist for about 13 years, and thouhg I have really enjoyed it, there are some aspects of the work that have become less fulfiling over the years. Helping people to feel bettter in their body, connecting on an individual level, and working with life, on a fundemental scale have been some of the major reasons I have stayed with the profession so long, but amidst these wonderful things there is and inescapable sense of ambiguity.  For example, lets say Mary comes in today, she is in a good mood and generally enjoys the work that we do. Today Mary has a some shoulder tension, and we are able to work it out with our tried and true techniques as well as have a great chat about life. Then Jim comes in, Jim is grumpy because his shoulder is hurting. I can see that his symptoms are very similar to Mary, so I begin to do the work, but don't feel the same results as I did with Mary. Unfourtunatley we are unable to resolve Jim's issue, and he doesn't come back for another appointment.
The big problem here for me was, no matter how much I systematized my work, or how much research I had that supported the work's efficacy, so much of the results where contingent on the clients receptivity during the session. This can become maddening. So I started to think of carreer choices out there that offered more black and white results, results that aren't effected by how someone feels at the time, or how I feel for that matter. If it works, it just works! If it doesn't, then the discussion we can have around the subject can be non emotional and based on the mechanics of the system. The constraints of software development fit the bill! The limits set by a language or program felt  liberating after years of mixed results! Learning to program has revitalized my trust in systems, and I am sure I will discover more as I continue.
