Integers, strings, and arrays, OH MY! There are so many things that can be done with just these data types, why even bother with anything else!? Well, for object-oriented programing, we need a little more functionality than what these primitive types have to offer, so in comes the hash.
I think one of the most important things to remember about the hash is it IS the object of object-oriented programing. Hashes can seem like an overcomplicated array at first, I mean why make the information harder to get to with all this 'key' business? We had to figure out how to find items in an array using the index and iterative methods and now the hash turns that on its head a bit. That's not to say that ALL the concepts of hashes are new, but without an understanding of the hash's role, it can feel a little redundant.

So if  I had to do it over again these are the things I'd try to understand first:

1. KNOW that the hash is the basis for object-oriented programing, not just an extra thing.
2. Key-value pairs aren't to complicate things, they're to organize and incapsulate
3. Accessing key/values can happen in MANY different ways, but most of the time dot notation does the trick.
    *  hash.name => dot notation
    *  hash[:name] => if the key is a symbol
    *  hash["name"] => if the key is a string
4. All of the new hash methods add precision and give options, but you've seen them all before.
5. KNOW what value is returned by the methods.
6. Hashes make a scaffolding that can be reused!

All in all, once I was able to get over the idea that hashes are just fancy arrays I was able to see their power and purpose. Go into learning this new data type with the knowledge that all you learn about the hash will not only level you up as a ruby developer but set you up for success as a programmer in general. Hashes aren't going away anytime soon, so get cozy and build some things!
